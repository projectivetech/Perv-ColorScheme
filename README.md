# Perv Color Scheme

**"Actually, as a native from Perv I prefer to be called a 'Pervect'"**  < *Aahz in Myth Directions* >


The color scheme was made because I was unsatiesfied with the limited syntax coloring of various color schemes-mainly missing coloring for C/C++, Ruby, JSON and ReST (Resturctured Text).  Therefore I created the Perv Orange Color Theme.

I tried to, kind of, group the colors together based on scopes.  Keywords, functions, etc. are red/orange; constants, strings, etc. are based on green; objects, classes, etc. are based on blue.

As it may happen, I may create additional color schemes, therefore the name of the repo is just "Perv Color Scheme" and the actual color scheme is called "Perv Orange".


## Installation

### Sublime Text 2

For the Sublime Text 2 editor the themes can be installed easily by using [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) to install the 'Perv Color Scheme' package from the official repository.

Otherwise, first find your Sublime Text 2 packages directory, you can find this by using the `Preferences -> Browse Packages` menu from within Sublime Text 2.

Now either create a `Perv -  color themes` folder within this directory, and copy the contents of the github repository inside, or clone the repo using the GIT software within the packages directory :

	git clone https://github.com/FlavourSys/Perv-ColorScheme "Perv - Color Scheme"

Now simply use the `Color Schemes` option of your preferences menu to switch between themes & enjoy!

## Thanks!

A very big thanks goes to [Dayle Rees](https://github.com/daylerees) for the work he has done with his [Color Schemes](https://github.com/daylerees/colour-schemes).  I used his Laravel Dark theme as a skeleton for this color scheme, as well as I used part of his readme.  Without that I wouldn't have made the push to GitHub ;)

Also I need to thank my collegues at [FlavourSys](http://www.flavoursys.com) for there valued input and comments-as well as the kick in the b... to push to GitHub.

*Always have fun in what you're doing and* "DON'T PANIC"...

**Enjoy!**
